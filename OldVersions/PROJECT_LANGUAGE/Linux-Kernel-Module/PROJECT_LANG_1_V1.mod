    "I decided to make Linux Kernel Module the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Linux-Kernel-Module) as Linux Kernel Module is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Linux Kernel Module programming language. It only makes sense to Linux Kernel Module the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here."
